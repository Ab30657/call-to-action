		"Ask-Buddie is an online technology community for technology enthusiasts founded on May 16th, 2017, by Ashish Yadav which is based in Nepal \n(Ask Buddie - A Platform For Technology Enthusiast, n.d.). It started as a Facebook community named ‘Tech Room Reload’ with a common goal to build a community to provide help and support for each other in technological aspects. The community itself is open to join and anyone interested can join with a few clicks. One of the major aspects this community follows is about contributing to the Open-Source community in the world of software development. ",

		"Data is one of the most important assets as of now. It is the most expensive entity in our world, yes, I’m talking about cryptocurrency (“Assets Ranked by Market Cap - CompaniesMarketCap.Com”). This should make people aware of how important data is, in today’s digital age. Your data being available to others through vulnerabilities present in websites, web apps, and irresponsible data dumping, data leaks which are equivalent to old-school stalking.\n\nLet's deal with the fact about how Google and Facebook were questioned for their off-app activities, and the list of things it tracks even if one isn’t actively using it. Companies end their side of the discussion by stating that there isn’t any unauthorized tracking being done, we as users should be aware of the possibility that there can be, because we will never be able to see the actual code being run in the back-end. Silicon Valley giants are frequent victims of data leaks, with millions of records about users, their bio-data being leaked through data dumps, etc. And there have been whistleblowers recently on how the company is not what it is portrayed to the outside world.",

		"One of the biggest threats of technological advancement in the 21st century is losing our data, our control over our privacy. Numerous data leaks of users from the very best of Silicon Valley giants, really questions, is our data safe, when we enter our data into their user interface without even stopping for a second, a second to just contemplate and question yourself.\n Is my data safe? Should I provide them with everything that I am? And the data leaks not only suggest, data and activities that you entered but also have traces of unauthorized data being recorded or tapped through hidden functionality in their apps and websites. So, what is the solution to this, you might wonder? \nOpen-Source Software(OSS) Community is one of the best ways to tackle this problem.",

This all points to bringing that transparency to the users, as per an article on TechRadar (Proffitt). These sorts of issues although minimal encourage the involvement and rise of OSS. You might think that if the code is open-source, it can be seen by evil people too. But think about it, the evil people searching for a specific vulnerability will never outnumber the anti-evil people searching for the same vulnerability. This ensures protection and security in a different sense.",

It is an open-source video streaming platform. This project is not only a sensation in terms of being open - source but it was also initiated to make new users familiar with how contributing to the open - source community works (R.
