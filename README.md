# University Project for Multimodal Call to Action

A multimodal assignment is simply one that blends multiple “modes” of communication to more effectively convey a message. While academic papers rely on one mode (text), a multi-modal assignment uses a combination of text, audio, images, video, and/or other visual design elements to persuade readers. As you might recall when you analyzed a meme earlier in the semester, the juxtaposition of text with an image can be an effective rhetorical technique.
